The Glasgow University Wireless Society has two Club callsigns - MS0 WSG and GS4AGU. The calls are available for members to make use of, and are used for Club operating days. The Net controller also uses MS0 WSG or GS4 AGU on our Monday night nets. From time to time we enter into radio contests under our Club calls.

**See our most recent QSOs on both callsigns below:**
