# Club Logbook

The Glasgow University Wireless Society has a Club callsign - MS0WSG. The call is available for members to make use of, and is used for Club operating days. The Net controller also uses MS0WSG on our Monday night nets. From time to time we enter into radio contests under our Club call.
