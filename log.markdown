# Club Logbook

The Glasgow University Wireless Society has two Club callsigns - MS0WSG and GS4AGU. The calls are available for members to make use of, and are used for Club operating days. The Net controller also uses MS0WSG or GS4AGU on our Monday night nets. From time to time we enter into radio contests under our Club calls.
