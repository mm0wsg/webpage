# About Us

![The GUWS logo](/images/logo.png)

The **Glasgow University Wireless Society** (GUWS) was founded in January 2023 by four Students and Postgraduate Researchers at the University of Glasgow. Following in the footsteps of other Amateur Radio Clubs at the University, the GUWS is still in its early days.

The University of Glasgow was founded in 1451, and for over five and a half centuries has been at the forefront of scientific advances. It was here that Kelvin and Lister studied and taught, here that Joseph Black worked on his gas problems (no pun intended), here that James Watt experimented with steam power, and here that Jocelyn Bell Burnell studied, before going on to help discover radio pulsars.

At time of writing the GUWS' membership stands at nine, of which five are active students or PGRs and three are alumni or former staff. The Society, although small, is keen to encourage newcomers into the hobby, help people progress through the three-tiered licensing structure, and to be a positive example of amateur radio within the University. Full membership is open to all matriculated students of the University, with Associate membership open to UofG staff, former staff, and alumni. Membership fees currently stand at a modest Â£10/year.

The Society has two Club Callsigns - [**MS0WSG**](https://www.qrz.com/db/ms0wsg "Our QRZ.com page") and [**GS4AGU**](https://www.qrz.com/db/gs4agu "Our QRZ page") - and is active in various contests and events. We run a weekly FM net for the Glasgow area. Anyone within range is welcome to join this Net - **145.525MHz (S21) from 1800hz on a Monday evening**. Our members have different passions within the hobby, including Summits on the Air and Morse code (CW) to name just a couple. We are keen to help others find their passions within amateur radio.
