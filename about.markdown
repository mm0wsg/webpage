# About Us

![The GUWS logo](/images/logo.png)

The **Glasgow University Wireless Society** (GUWS) was founded in January 2023 by four Students and Postgraduate Researchers at the University of Glasgow. Following in the footsteps of other Amateur Radio Clubs at the University, the GUWS is still in its early days.

The University of Glasgow was founded in 1451, and for over five hundred years has been at the forefront of scientific advances. It was here that Kelvin and Lister worked, studied and taught. It was here that Joseph Black worked on his gases (no pun intended), here that James Watt experimented with steam power, and here that Jocelyn Bell Burnell studied, before going on to help discover radio pulsars.

At present the GUWS' membership stands at seven, of which four are active students or PGRs and three are alumni or former staff. The Society, although small, is keen to encourage newcomers into the hobby, help people progress through the three-tiered licensing structure, and to be a positive example of amateur radio within the University.

The Society has a Club Callsign - [MS0WSG] (https://www.qrz.com/db/ms0wsg "Our QRZ.com page") - and is active in various contests and events. We run a weekly FM net for the Glasgow area. Anyone within range is welcome to join this Net - **145.525MHz (S21) from 1800hz on a Monday evening**.

In time we hope to add more to this webpage, but please bookmark the page and check back for future updates as they come.

Thanks for visiting our page. 73 es GL.
