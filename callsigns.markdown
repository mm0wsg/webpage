As you will read from [this blog update](https://www.mm0wsg.radio/jekyll/update/2023/04/17/GM4AGU.html), the Glasgow University Wireless Society has two callsigns assigned for our use.

These are **MS0WSG** *(Wireless Society Glasgow)*, and **GS4AGU** *(Amateurs Glasgow University)*.

Our **MS0WSG** callsign was applied for, and is held by, Torin MM1STK. This was our first callsign and was applied for on the day we formed the Society, in January 2023.

Our **GS4AGU** callsign has a far earlier pedigree, however. The image below is taken from the January 1972 edition of *The Short Wave Magazine*, and shows the newly assigned callsign (at that time simply GM4 and not GS4 - the special Club RSLs being introduced later).

A year later, in January 1973, the Glasgow University Club came third in Scotland in the *Short Wave Magazine Club Contest*, held on 04 - 05 November 1972.

At this point the trail goes cold. If you have any more information about the Glasgow Club, or its callsign GM4AGU, please let us know.
