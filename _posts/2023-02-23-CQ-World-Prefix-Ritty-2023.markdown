# CQ World Prefix RTTY 2023

On 11th February 2023, Torin MM1STK and Michael 2M0GUI took part in the CQ WPX RTTY Contest from 2M0GUI's QTH. They operated using the Club Call (MS0WSG), giving the Call its first HF 'outing'.

It was a day of firsts. As mentioned, it was the first time that the Club Call had been used on HF. It was Michael's first time using FLDigi in a contest, and it was Torin's first time using RTTY!

After a slow start (who knew that RTTY-Reverse wouldn't make many contacts?!) the pair made just shy of 100 QSOs - although sadly about four were lost from the Log early on.

The picture below shows the statistics by band and continent. MS0WSG only operated for about 6hrs in a 48hr contest, so our numbers were obviously on the low side - but given it was with a relatively modest station (100w to an EFLW), and more of an experiment than anything else, both Torin and Michael were pleased with the figures.
