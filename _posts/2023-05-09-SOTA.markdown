# Glasgow University Wireless Society Members Activate Highland Summit

GUWS members Cristian MM0UXD and Radu MM7CVF spent the Bank Holiday weekend activating the most northerly Munro in Scotland, Ben Hope (*Beinn HÃ²b* in Scots Gaelic). Devoted **Summits on the Air** fans, in recent weeks they have also activated Ben Vane and Beinn Narnain. They even called in to the GUWS Monday Night Net from the side of Ben Vane!11

Ben Hope offers views across to the Orkney Islands and Pentland Firth and offers a good site for V/UHF contacts over some 100km. Cris and Radu also managed contacts into England, Wales, and Germany on HF.
