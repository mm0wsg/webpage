# Glasgow University Wireless Society Activity Day - 13th May 2023 from 1.00pm

Be sure to listen out for the Glasgow University Wireless Society as we go out /P in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow (IO75UU), in the shadow of the historic University of Glasgow Campus.

We will be setting up for around 1.00pm, and aim to be active on 40m, 20m and 15m, plus VHF if possible.

We will log to eQSL, LoTW and QRZ.com, and we now have paper QSL cards available on request.

Hope to hear you on the air!
