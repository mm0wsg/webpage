# Glasgow University Wireless Society Monday Night Nets begin summer break

The GUWS 2m Nets, which take place on Mondays at 18.00 local time, are taking a break over the summer holidays. We anticipate these re-starting in September, but will make any announcement through the usual channels.

We would like to thank the local amateurs who have called in, whether members or not. We hope to hear you again in the new academic year.

73, from the GUWS Committee
