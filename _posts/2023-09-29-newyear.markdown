After an enjoyable summer break, the GUWS returned with a bang on Friday evening with their inaugral meeting.

After a successful leaflet campaign across campus, we were pleased to welcome three new members, Yinan, Tom and Adam.

We've an exciting year ahead, including a Foundation Licence training day (on 21st October), a visit to the Stirling ARC's shack, and a Christmas outing. We are also planning to start monthly meetings, welcoming visiting speakers and arranging introductions to the many and exciting aspects of amateur radio.
