# Autism Awareness Week 2023 - 25th March to 2nd April

Between 25th March and 2nd April, one of our members, Michael GM5AUG will be operating as [**GB5AAW**](https://www.qrz.com/db/gb5aaw) to mark Autism Awareness Week. 

It is estimated that almost one in a hundred people live with autism, which the [National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism) describes as 
*a lifelong developmental disability which affects how people communicate and interact with the world.*

The idea of marking Autism Awareness Week began with James, [KB2FMH](https://www.qrz.com/db/kb2fmh). He and the other American operators are running as [W2A](https://www.qrz.com/db/w2a), while another Scottish operator, Colin [GM4JPZ](https://www.qrz.com/db/gm4jpz) is running as [GB2AAW](https://www.qrz.com/db/gb2aaw).

Be sure to listen out for the stations on the air, and visit their QRZ.com pages for more information!
