When Jim, GM4NTL, reached out to his RSGB District Representative for some assistance in repairing his aerials, he wouldn't have expected a team of University students to lend a hand!

This weekend Torin MM1STK, Alzbeta MM/OM1DP and Michael GM5AUG travelled down from Glasgow to near Sanquhar to help rebuild Jim's antenna 'farm' and reorganise his shack.

As well as cutting a dipole for a 60m spot frequency, the team made a fan dipole for some of the higher HF bands, reorganised and labelled the many feeders coming in to the shack, and fault-finded the various rotators and winch systems. A special part of the weekend was Jim being able to share his radio knowledge with the young team, giving helpful advice for coiling wires and siting aerials.

Jim, 85, a former Royal Signals radio operator, reflecting on the weekend, said "I could not have asked for a better group of youngsters, they're a credit to the hobby."

As the GUWS does not have a shack of its own, Jim has kindly invited the Society to use his QTH as their /A shack. So listen out for MS0WSG/A and GS4AGU/A in the coming weeks and months!

Michael GM5AUG (GUWS Chairman and DR13), said "It was excellent that the GUWS were able to offer assistance to Jim in this way. All of us learned a lot and bonded as a team. We look forward to visting Sanquhar again and operating from Jim's excellent QTH."
